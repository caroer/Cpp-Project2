# SF2565 Program Construction in C++, Project 2

Source code for evaluation of the exponential function using Taylor series, where "task1.cpp" handles real numbers and "matrix.cpp" creates a matrix-class and thus handles exponential functions with matrices. The latter compares the own implementation with implementation from "r8mat_expm1.h".
